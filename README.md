# Lost Pet Finders Project

A service where you can track down your lost pet. Uses publicly available geotag devices / human submitted “spots” to locate a pet matching your description. Anyone can freely register to be a “spotter”. Any visitor can “quick locate” their pet using a google-esque query bar.
